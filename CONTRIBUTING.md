# Contributing to the opendata issue tracker

Please keep the following guidelines in mind when creating, commenting on or closing the issues here:
 1. There are non-Estonians watching and contributing, please use English whenever possible.
 2. If you know already who might own the data you are looking for, please mention this in the comments. Leave labelling to the backlog grooming team.
 3. Should something already be work in progress (awesome!) or you choose to move an issue to another repo in Github, please reference the original discussion from there as described in [#71](https://github.com/okestonia/opendata-issue-tracker/issues/71).
