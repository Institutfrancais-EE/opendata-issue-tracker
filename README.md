**We are waiting: city activists, mobility experts interested in improving urban space, infrastructure geeks, archidects designing common space!**

This challenge is focusing on using data to create effective and sustainable mobility models. How to make smooth trips and interchanges for commuting between urban and suburban areas? What innovations are most needed to provide cost-effective, need-based and sustainable modes of transport? How can we provide more accessible public transport for people with special needs? What kind of innovative and sustainable transport solutions could be offered to statisfy the mobility demand of people living in suburban and rural areas?

### Challenge: Estonian Data Protection Inspectorate - How to ensure that privacy is protected?
https://github.com/okestonia/opendata-issue-tracker/issues/74

All Estonian government agencies must publish their document registries and they usually do. Occasionally, however, the published documents and metadata by mistake contain sensitive personal information that should not be published. This is a major obstacle in making document registries machine readable en masse. The challenge, should you accept it, is to figure out ways to trawl common document registry solutions deployed in Estonian public institutions detecting possible privacy violations. Good luck!

### Challenge: Tele2 invites you to try your hand at Location-Based Analysis!
https://github.com/okestonia/opendata-issue-tracker/issues/78

Tele2 will supply hackathon participants with anonymized VLR (Visitor Location Register) data. This data describes cell switches within a 12-month period in Tele2’s 2G and 3G network – when a device connects to a Tele2 network station. By combining this data with a map of the locations of Tele2 stations, it is possible to put together approximate location-based analysis (LBA).

The data provided is obscured to protect the privacy of our customers, yet this is an exclusive chance to use a mobile operator’s data to build services on location-based data. Maybe you’d like to build an app that suggests kindergartens or schools to parents with a specific route, so they can save time on commuting? Or try your hand at traffic analysis to optimize road planning? Combining the VLR data with other data available at the event and open data available online is bound to yield interesting results.

The amount of data is large and will be accessible to participants through a Hadoop framework. More details will be revealed prior to the event.

### Challenge: data-driven solutions using the vast amounts of media industry data
https://github.com/okestonia/opendata-issue-tracker/issues/79

Ekspress Media is the leading media group, whose activities include online media content production and publishing newspapers and magazines. This means collecting vast amounts of data. For the hackathon you can access all their published articles + you can analyse, systemise, categorise this data with the http://www.texta.ee/ tool.

Data-driven solutions, telling stories with data, dealing with messy data, engaging audiences - the challenge is what you create it to be.

Ekspress Media will give out a special prize and follow-up support to the solution they pick to be the best.

### Challenge: Value added solutions for merchants or payment card users
https://github.com/okestonia/opendata-issue-tracker/issues/80

SEB makes available representative dataset of card payment transactions with merchant category and approximate location information. Such data give insights for example to customer payment behavior as well as merchant category business volumes in the region. For privacy reasoning the customer as well as merchant information is anonymized.
We invite to propose value added solutions to merchants and/or to card users.

## Background of the initiative

Estonian government agencies and local municipalities make datasets available in an open format – these are published in the government repository. https://opendata.riik.ee/et/data/search

In Estonian-Open-Data-Issue-Tracker repository, Open Knowledge Estonia is independently crowd-sourcing to learn about what kind of data people need to use and which open data should be available.

We believe that persons and organizations who use the data are in a strong position to advocate for more and higher quality open data. We have used Global Open Data Index as a model but we are adding categories that are not covered in Open Data Index. http://global.survey.okfn.org/

The Global Open Data Index tracks whether this data is actually released in a way that is accessible to citizens, media and civil society. OK-EE wants to give a crowdsourced input to the global survey of open data releases. Contributions are welcome!
